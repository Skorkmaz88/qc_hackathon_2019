# Quantum Futures Hackathon - Machine Learning Installation

This document explains how to prepare an environment to run example code.
In this example, [qulacs](http://qulacs.org) is used.
Participants may use [qiskit](https://qiskit.org) instead by modifying the example code.
Both qiskit and qulacs can be installed using pip.


# Making and activating a virutalenv.
```
$ virtualenv hackathon_2019
```

If you need to specify a path to the python command.
```
$ virtualenv hackathon_2019 -p /usr/bin/python3.6
```

Then activate the virtualenv.
```
source hackathon_2019/bin/activate
```

# Changing the compiler version
Installation of qulacs requires GCC7 or newer.
You may need to install compatible GCC to your system; you may need a root permission.


# Changing the compiler version
Installation of qulacs requires GCC7 or newer.
You may need to install compatible GCC to your system; you may need a root permission.
```
# yum install centos-release-scl
# yum install devtoolset-7-gcc-c++
```
After the installation of GCC7, you, as a normal user, can change the version,
```
$ scl enable devtoolset-7 bash
```

Now you may need to install relatively new cmake,
```
pip install cmake
```
then other packages.
```
pip install qiskit qulacs matplotlib
```
